{"name":"Lab-website","tagline":"django based code for a lab website.","body":"This project includes the source code for a django/python based biomedical research laboratory website.  This was largely configured for personal use, but is licensed under a CC0 free license, so feel free to copy and modify with no restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation and Setup\r\n======================\r\n1. Clone or download this code and extract it somewhere on your system.\r\n2. Inside the lab_website directory, open **localsettings_empty.py** with a text editor and fill in **'django.db.backends.sqlite3'** under DATABASES... ENGINE and enter a location for your SQLite database to be stored under NAME.  To use other database types see the `Django Documentation on Databases <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/databases/>`_.\r\n3. Optional:  Fill in the the ADMINS, TIME_ZONE and LANGUAGE_CODE as needed.  \r\n4. Save this file as **localsettings.py** in the same directory.\r\n4. Run the following command within the Lab Website directory to populate the database.  Enter the superuser information when prompted::\r\n\r\n    python manage.py syncdb\r\n    python manage.py schemamigration communication --initial\r\n    python manage.py schemamigration papers --initial\r\n    python manage.py schemamigration personnel --initial\r\n    python manage.py schemamigration projects --initial    \r\n    python manage.py migrate --fake\r\n    \r\nTesting\r\n--------\r\nRun the test suite with::\r\n\r\n    python manage.py test\r\n    \r\nIn localsettings.py, set Debug=FALSE when you have verified everything is working.    \r\n    \r\nDependencies and Other Apps\r\n===========================\r\nThe two main software dependencies for this project are `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ and `Django <http://djangoproject.org>`_.  You will require a database backend and a webserver for proper function.  For detailed installation instructions for Django see `Django Installation Instructions <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/install/>`_\r\n\r\nThe current version uses Python 2.7 and Django 1.4.  \r\n\r\nTo install python dependencies, entering on a command line:: \r\n\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    \r\nAnother python package dependency is the python-oauth2 library.  This can be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/brosner/python-oauth2.\r\n\r\nThis project also includes links to three other apps which would have to be installed and configured separately:\r\n\r\n* Blog: any blogging software served at http://yourserver/blog\r\n* Protocol Wiki: a wikimedia based protocol site served at http://yourserver/wiki\r\n* MouseDB: a database for animal colony management which can optionally be served at http://yoursever/mousedb.  Based on software available at http://github.com/davebridges/mousedb\r\n* ExperimentDB: a data and laboratory inventory management tool which can optionally be served at http://yourserver/experimentdb.  Uses software available at https://github.com/davebridges/ExperimentDB    \r\n    ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
